## Studio Ghibli API

    Studio Ghibli API is a website to showcase films that Studio Ghibli has done over the years. The website provides a variety of information from description of films to characters. 

## Design Process

    This website is targetted at audiences who are curious about Studio Ghibli, and also long-term fans of Studio Ghibli to reminisce about the past. For those who are interested in Studio Ghibli and its films, my website can help them achieve their goals by providing them with film titles, descriptions, and characters in the films as well. For those who are veterans in the anime scene, pictures, names, and story descriptions can help the visualize and revisit the films they have watched.

    User Stories:

        As a user new to Studio Ghibli, I want to find out more about its films, so that I can decide if its films are my cup of tea.
        As a user that has watched Studio Ghibli films for a long time, I want to revisit its films, so that I can reminisce in the past.

## Features

    Existing features:

        Drop-down menu: Users can hover over the drop-down menu to reveal a sub-menu consisting of alphabets that categorize each film.

        Navigation menu: Upon hovering over an alphabt in the sub-menu, users can click on a film to navigate to that particular film.

        Moving cards: Upon hovering on a film/card, the card transitions upwards.

        Clickable images: Clicking an image will direct the user to another page, where the fetch data of the film they clicked is displayed.

        Dedicated mobile website: The website not only caters to desktop users, but also mobile users.

    
    Features left to implement:

        Smooth Transitioning (When accessing another page): Instead of an abrupt page switch, the background of the initial page will display an animation which will then transition into the next page.

        Search bar: User can type in the search bar to search for any film.
